## Ingredients:
	1 kg cubed blade, round, topside or cheap rump steak
	50 to 70 g diced pork or smoked bacon (in the piece not sliced)
	2 cloves crushed garlic
	1 large chopped onion
	1 large diced carrot
	oil
	2 tablespoons plain flour
	1/4 cup beef stock
	1 cup red wine
	12 small onions (pickling onions)
	250 g button mushrooms
	chopped parsley
	1 teaspoon died thyme
	2 to 3 dried bay leaves
	freshly ground black pepper
	salt to taste

## Instructions:
	Trim excess fat from beef cut into cubes.
	Dice bacon.
	Heat a frying pan and cook bacon then place in the casserole dish.
	Saute chopped onion, crushed garlic and diced carrot in bacon fat then place in casserole dish.
	Brown cubed steak (add oil as required) then place in casserole dish.
	Stir in flour in frying pan and cook for 30 seconds add stock and red wine.
	Stirring constantly until mixture thickens.
	Pour over meat add salt, ground pepper and thyme cover and cook in a slow oven 160 C or 325 F for 2 hours less if using rump
	Stir in the 12 small onion 45 minutes into cooking (if using rump stir in with the stock). 10 minutes before serving saut√© button mushroom in a little butter and add to casserole. Remove bay leaves before serving. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

Notes: Most casseroles are best when prepared 1-2 day before and reheated when required.  In which case leave the button mushrooms and parsley until serving. I always check liquid half way through the cooking and adjust if required- if too running you can thicken with gravy flour. Gravy flour is very useful to thicken any casserole because it will not go lumpy.  These days I use cheap rump because I have found other forms of casserole steak tough but experiment and see what you prefer.

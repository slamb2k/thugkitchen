## Ingredients:
**Rack of Lamb**
	4 x 3 bone racks of lamb, French trimmed
	Salt and pepper
	2 tsp harissa paste
	1 heaped tsp cinnamon
	1 heaped tsp cumin
	1 heaped tsp coriander
	1 tbsp grated ginger

**Couscous Salad**
	300 g couscous
	350 ml very hot chicken or vegetable stock
	1 bunch of chopped mint leaves
	1 bunch of chopped coriander
	16 to 20 sliced green olives
	1 preserved lemon, finely chopped (grated zest of 1/2 lemon can be used as an alternative)
	2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
	large handful of pistachios
	freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions:
**For Rack of Lamb**
	Heat the oven to 200C/220C fan ovens/Gas mark 7.
	Mix together the harissa, spices and grated ginger and keep to one side.
	Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat a large frying pan or roasting tray and place the lamb fat side down (it isnâ€™t necessary to add any oil to the pan as the fat on the lamb will be released as soon as it hits the pan). Colour the lamb all over on a high heat and then remove onto a plate or board.
	Spread or rub the spicy harissa paste all over the coloured lamb and return the lamb to the frying pan or roasting tray. Place in the oven for 8 minutes for the lamb to be cooked medium-rare (or a few minutes longer if you prefer it to be cooked medium-well).
	Once the lamb is cooked, remove from the oven and leave to rest for a few minutes before slicing into cutlets and serving with the couscous salad.

**For the couscous**
	Place the couscous in a large bowl and pour over the hot stock. Stir, cover with cling film and leave for about 5 minutes for the stock to be absorbed. Fluff up the couscous with a fork and add the rest of the ingredients and serve with the lamb.

| **Title** | Fast and Snappy Fresh Peanut and Radish Salad |
| **Description** |  It seems that every April I have to remind myself that while I'm waiting for more and more of the fruits and vegetables of Spring and Summer to arrive, I need to take advantage of what's blooming and budding all around me. I also go looking for cheap, and it's great and good friend, easy. Maybe it's the time of year when I just don't want to work too hard. After all, the clocks have been set back and I'm only now catching up . Every now and then it's helpful to find something that everyone likes and that can be put together easily. That's where the radish and peanut salad comes in. |

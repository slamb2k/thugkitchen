## Ingredients:
	1 cup quick-cooking couscous
	1/4 cup currants
	1 1/4 cups boiling chicken or vegetable stock
	3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
	2 tablespoons lemon juice
	1 clove garlic-minced
	1 teaspoon ground cumin
	1 teaspoon ground coriander

	2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

## Instructions:
	MIX the couscous with the raisins in a bowl and pour over the boiling stock.
	COVER with a dish towel, plate or plastic wrap to seal in the steam and let sit for 5 minutes.
	PLACE the oil, lemon juice, garlic, spices, and salt in a jar with a screw-top lid and shake to mix.
	FLUFF the couscous with a fork to separate the grains and stir through the carrot, red pepper, onion, chickpeas and parsley.
	POUR over the dressing and toss together until well combined.

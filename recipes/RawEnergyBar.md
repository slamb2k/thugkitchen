## Ingredients:
	2 cups pitted dates
	3/4 cup raw cashews
	1/4 cup nut butter (I used natural peanut butter)
	1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
	2 tablespoons cocoa powder
	1 pinch salt

## Instructions:
	Toss everything into a food processor and process until the mixture starts to go smooth and clump into a ball. The dates will be all chopped up but you'll still have bits of nut.
	Turn the mixture out into an 8 or 9 inch square dish lined with parchment paper. Use your hands to firmly press the mixture into the bottom of the dish. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
	Remove the bars from the pan and cut into pieces using a sharp knife. Enjoy these bars cold or frozen. Store in an air-tight container in the fridge or freezer.

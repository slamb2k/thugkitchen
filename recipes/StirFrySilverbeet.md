## Ingredients:
	8 to 10 medium-large leaves of silver beet
	2 to 3 Tbsp light cooking oil
	1 Tbsp pine nuts
	2 boned, skinless chicken breasts, finely sliced, dusted with cornflour
	1 medium onion, peeled and finely sliced
	1 red pepper, deseeded and finely sliced
	1/2 cup vegetable stock or water
	Salt and pepper to taste
	2 tsp cornflour
	1 Tbsp water
	2 Tbsp sherry
	Hoison sauce to taste

## Instructions:
	If the leaves are very large, strip off the greens and cut the ribs crossways into fine slices. Tear the leaves into large pieces, wash and dry.
	Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan, add the pine nuts and cook, stirring until they colour. Remove immediately and keep warm.
	Add more oil, shake any excess cornflour off the chicken strips, add to the wok or pan and stir-fry until the meat is firm and coloured.
	Push to one side, and add the onion and red pepper slices and cook until soft.
	If the silver beet ribs have been sliced, add now and stir-fry for a minute.
	Add the leaves, followed immediately by the vegetable stock or water, and salt and pepper.
	Cook, stirring until the leaves begin to wilt. The chicken strips should be cooked through, but check to make sure; if not, continue to cook, stirring throughout.
	Combine the cornflour, water and sherry, and mix until smooth.
	Add to the wok or pan and stir briskly, then lower the heat, add the pine nuts, cover the wok or pan and simmer for 3-4 minutes.
	Serve immediately.

## Ingredients:
	Herb Yoghurt
		200 g Greek Yoghurt
		A generous handful of mixed fresh herbs, finely chopped (coriander, mint, parsley & chives are all great)
		1 Garlic Clove Crushed

	Baghdad Eggs
		4 Eggs
		25 g Butter
		1/2 tsp hot paprika
		Squeeze of lemon juice

	Toast
		2 tbsp olive oil
		1 tsp ground cumin
		Salt and Pepper to taste

## Instructions:
	Make the yoghurt sauce by stirring through the herbs and seasoning to taste with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon into two bowls and set aside.
	Mix cumin, olive oil and seasoning in a small bowl.
	Brush the oil over some toast and then grill on both sides. Set aside.
	Poach the eggs and add to the yoghurt bowls
	While the eggs are poaching, heat a frying pan over a high heat with the butter and paprika and cook until it starts to go slightly brown and nutty. Add the lemon juice, watching out as it will splutter. Place two eggs into each bowl of yoghurt. Drizzle the butter over the egg and yoghurt.

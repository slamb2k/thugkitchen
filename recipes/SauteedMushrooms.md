## Ingredients:
	2 handfuls of mushrooms, wiped clean
	1 clove of garlic, finely chopped
	A few sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves picked
	A few sprigs of fresh parsley,
	Salt and Pepper
	1 fresh red chili, minced
	A small knob of butter
	1 lemon

## Instructions:
	Put a large heavy frying pan, big enough to hold all the mushrooms in one layer, over heat and add a couple of glugs of extra virgin olive oil.
	Add them all to the pan and give it a shake to toss the mushrooms in the oil.
	Add the chopped garlic and thyme and shake the pan again.
	Add a pinch of salt and pepper and the minced chili and leave to fry gently for a few minutes.
	If the mixture becomes dry, pour in a little more oil. Once the mushrooms have got some color going on, after about 3-4 minutes, add the butter and a small squeeze of lemon juice, you donâ€™t need much - and toss again.
	To finish this off and make it into a lovely, creamy sauce, spoon 2-3 tablespoons of water into the pan.

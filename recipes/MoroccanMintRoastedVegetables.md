## Ingredients:
	1 lb / 16 oz / 450 g mix of potatoes, cauliflower, and a few radishes (save the tops)
	1 1/2 teaspoons dried mint
	1/2 teaspoon red chile pepper flakes
	1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
	1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
	1 teaspoon ground cumin
	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
	1 teaspoon ground ginger
	4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
	a squeeze of fresh lemon juice
	toppings: fresh mint, toasted sesame and/or pumpkin seeds, plain yogurt (seasoned with a bit of salt)

## Instructions:
	Preheat your oven to 425F / 220C. Wash and dry the vegetables, then cut the potatoes and cauliflower into 1/4-inch thick slices/pieces. Trim and quarter the radishes, setting aside the green radish tops.
	Place the dried mint, chile pepper flakes, cumin seeds, and salt in a mortar and pestle and pound a bit, long enough to somewhat break up the cumin seeds. Add the ground cumin, cinnamon, and ground ginger. After that, add the olive oil and stir until combined.
	Place the potatoes, cauliflower, and radishes in a large bowl. Pour the spiced olive oil over the vegetables and toss gently but thoroughly - until everything is equally coated. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until everything is cooked through.
	Remove from the oven and serve on a platter topped with the radish greens, a squeeze of lemon and any/all of the other toppings. A fat dollop of salted yogurt really brings everything together.

Notes: As I mention in the main post, I used a mix of what looked good and seasonal at my local market here, but feel free to mix it up a bit. You could certainly do pumpkin or other winter squash here, or straight potatoes (no cauliflower / radish), or green beans and broccoli in the summer. Asparagus and artichokes in the spring, etc.

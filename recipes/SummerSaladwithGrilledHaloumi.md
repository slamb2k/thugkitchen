## Ingredients:
	3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
	1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
	300 g young green beans, blanched
	4 ripe tomatoes, quartered, then halved
	1/2 small red onion, slivered
	1/2 cup (90g) marinated kalamata olives
	1 cup (20g) baby rocket leaves
	1 cup mixed baby basil and flat-leaf parsley leaves
	2 x250g packets haloumi, cut in 1cm-thick slices

## Instructions:
	Combine 2 tablespoons oil and the vinegar in a bowl; season with salt and plenty of black pepper. Add beans, tomato, onion, olives, rocket and herbs; lightly toss to combine. Divide salad between serving plates.
	Meanwhile, preheat a barbecue flatplate (or use a non-stick frying pan over high heat). Add remaining oil. Cook haloumi for 1 minute each side until golden and slightly crusty. Place on salads; drizzle with a little extra vinegar. Serve at once.

## Ingredients:
## Instructions:
Notes:  to get perfect crackling every time, lightly rub fine cooking salt into the skin of your pork and leave uncovered in your refrigerator overnight; this will draw out excess moisture from the skin.
Before roasting, rub off excess salt and caramelise the skin in a saucepan first, then roast in the oven. Your crackling will be light, airy and crunchy.
Always ask for rare-breed, free-roaming or organic pork products for the best flavour and good fat covering to retain moisture.

## Ingredients:
	1 x 400g can of chickpeas, well-rinsed and patted dry, pop onto a baking tray and pop in oven for 3 minutes whilst it’s heating up to make sure they’re dry.
	5 grams vanilla extract
	170 grams natural peanut butter
	80 grams agave
	5 grams baking powder**
	a pinch of salt if your peanut butter doesn’t have salt in it
	90 grams chocolate chips

## Instructions:
	Preheat your oven to 175°C.
	Place all the ingredients into thermie (except for the chocolate chips) blitz until very smooth.
	Make sure to scrape the sides and the top to get the little chunks of chickpeas and process again until they’re combined.
	Pop in chocolate chips and stir it if you can, or pulse it once or twice. The mixture should be thick and sticky.
	Wet hands; form into 1 1/2″ balls. Place onto a piece of baking paper. Press down slightly on the balls and sprinkle chips on top. They don’t do much rising.
	Bake for about 10 minutes.
	Makes about 20.

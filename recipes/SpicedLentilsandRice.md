## Ingredients:
	1 1/2 cup brown rice (brown basmati is good)
	3/4 cup lentils
	2 cinnamon sticks, broken in half
	6 cloves
	1/2 tsp. cumin
	1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
	1 tsp. salt (optional)
	1/4 cup minced parsley
	Squeeze of lemon juice (optional)

## Instructions:
	Put all ingredients except parsley into the rice cooker. Add water according to your rice cooker’s instruction manual or use 4 cups of water. Stir and set to Cook. When the cooker shuts off, check to make sure both rice and lentils are tender and no water remains. If they are not tender, add 1/4 cup more water and restart. (This shouldn’t be necessary, but rice cookers do vary.)
	When done, remove the cinnamon and cloves, fluff the rice, and add the minced parsley. Stir in a squeeze of lemon juice, if you like.

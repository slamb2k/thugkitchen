## Ingredients:
	100 g unsalted butter
	180 g (1 full cup) sugar (I like to do about half white, and half brown or rapadura sugar)
	240 g very ripe banana
	1/2 vanilla bean, scraped
	2 large eggs
	pinch of sea salt
	2 tablespoons sour cream or yogurt
	225 g (1 1/2 cups) self-raising flour
	1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
	dash of milk (only if mixture seems too dense and doesn't move when bowl is tilted)

## Instructions:
	Pre-heat oven to 180C (160C if using fan-forced)
	Place butter, sugar, bananas and vanilla into TMX bowl
	Mix at Speed 4 for around 10 seconds until smooth and liquid
	Add egg, sour cream and salt
	Mix again on Speed 4 for a few seconds
	Add flour and soda (3/4 tsp bicarb, 3/4 tsp baking powder if plain)
	Mix again on Speed 3 until well combined (just a few seconds)
	If the mixture does not seem very liquid (you should be able to pour most of it out into your loaf pan), then add some milk and blitz again on Speed 3 for a second or two
	Transfer mixture to a medium loaf pan that is lined with baking paper
	Bake for 50 minutes or until knife/skewer comes out clean when you stab the middle

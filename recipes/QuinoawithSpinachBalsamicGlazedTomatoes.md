| **Title** | Quinoa with Spinach & Balsamic GlazedÂ Tomatoes |
| **Description** | This has to be my most favourite quinoa salad dish to date! Last night we wanted something really light and healthy and this ticked all the boxes. Recently you may be noticing that I have been creating a lot of Mediterranean recipes. I just love the flavours and am probably secretly craving the sun, sea and sand! |

## Ingredients:
	150 g baby spinach
	12 asparagus spears chopped
	16 cherry tomatoes halved
	1 tbsp olive oil
	1 garlic clove minced
	1/2 tsp salt or to taste
	1/2 tsp dried oregano
	Dash of Balsamic vinegar
	1 1/2 cup pre cooked quinoa
	Feta cheese (optional)

## Instructions:
	Heat up the oil in a deep pan with the garlic on a medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the asparagus and cherry tomatoes
	Season with the salt and oregano. Stir fry so that everything is coated in oil. Lower the heat and cook for 5-8 minutes until the asparagus is tender
	Splash in a little Balsamic vinegar and mix well. Place the fresh spinach on top of the cooked asparagus and tomatoes and turn off the heat
	This way the spinach will wilt a little but largely remain soft and fresh. Leave to sit for 10 minutes.
	Place the quinoa in a large mixing bowl, mix in the asparagus, tomatoes and spinach. Making sure you get all the juices and dressing in
	Combine well and serve warm with some crumbled feta cheese

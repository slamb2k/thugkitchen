## Ingredients:
	2 to 3 heads of small cauliflower (or 1/2 head large)
	2 tablespoons of olive oil
	a couple pinches of sea salt
	1 clove garlic, minced
	1 small bunch of chives, chopped
	zest of one lemon
	freshly grated Parmesan
	a bit of flaky sea salt

## Instructions:
	To prep the cauliflower, remove any leaves at the base and trim the stem. Now cut it into tiny trees - and by tiny, I mean most florets aren't much larger than a table grape. Make sure the pieces are relatively equal in size, so they cook in the same amount of time. Rinse under running water, and set aside.
	Heat the olive oil and fine grain salt in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the cauliflower and stir until the florets are coated. Wait until it gets a bit brown on the bottom, then toss the cauliflower with a spatula. Brown a bit more and continue to saute until the pieces are deeply golden - all told about six minutes. In the last 30 seconds stir in the garlic.
	Remove from heat and stir in the chives, lemon zest, and dust with a bit of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a pinch of flaky sea salt (if you have it on hand). Serve immediately.

## Ingredients:
	2 cup moong dal (split green gram)
	1 knob of butter and slurp of oil
	1 tbsp ginger-garlic (adrak-lehsun) paste
	3 finely chopped onions
	3 finely chopped tomatoes
	1 finely chopped green chilli
	1 tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
	1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)
	1/4 tsp turmeric powder (haldi)
	1 1/2 tsp chilli powder
	1/2 tsp garam masala
	4 tbsp four leaves south indian dahl spice mix
	salt to taste

## Instructions:
	Add a knob of butter and some oil to a fry pan.
	Add the ginger-garlic paste to the pan.
	Add the cumin seeds until they pop.
	Add the onions, dried fenugreek leaves, curry leaves, green chillies and saute on medium flame for 3 to 4 minutes or until onions are translucent.
	Add the tomatoes, turmeric powder, chilli powder, garam masala and four leaves spice mixture. Stir well and cook for a further 5 minutes.
	Add the lentils and the mixture to the pressure cooker and mix well.
	Add 6 cups of water to the pressure cooker.
	Set the pressure cooker to run on high for 20 minutes if using an electronic model. If using a traditional pressure cooker, pressure cook on a high flame for whistles and then lower the flame for another whistle.
	Let the pressure escape naturally before opening the lid.
	Stir lemon and coriander into the dal.
	Garnish with greek yoghurt and service with rice or roti.

Notes: I don't bother soaking the lentils and just let the pressure cooker do all the work.

## Ingredients:
	2 tbs pine nuts
	1 piece Lebanese bread, split
	80 ml (1/3 cup) olive oil
	Pinch of sea salt flakes
	1 lemon
	3 green zucchini, cut lengthways into 4mm-thick slices
	3 yellow zucchini, cut lengthways into 4mm-thick slices
	1/3 cup fresh mint leaves
	75 g feta, crumbled

## Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Place the pine nuts on a baking tray. Bake for 5 minutes or until light golden. Transfer to a small bowl.
	Place Lebanese bread on the tray. Brush with 2 teaspoons of oil. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepper. Bake for 3-4 minutes each side or until golden. Set aside to cool. Break into large pieces.
	Meanwhile, use a zester to remove the rind from the lemon. (Alternatively, use a vegetable peeler to peel rind from lemon. Use a small sharp knife to remove white pith from rind. Cut rind into very thin strips.) Juice the lemon. Whisk together the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of oil in a small jug. Season with salt and pepper.
	Preheat a barbecue grill on high. Place the combined zucchini and remaining oil in a large bowl and combine. Cook the zucchini for 2 minutes each side or until golden and tender.
	Combine the zucchini, mint and three-quarters of the dressing in a bowl. Arrange half the zucchini mixture and half the bread on a serving platter. Top with remaining zucchini, bread, pine nuts and feta. Drizzle over the remaining dressing. Serve.

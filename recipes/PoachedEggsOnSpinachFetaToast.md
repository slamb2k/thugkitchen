## Ingredients:
	1/4 cup frozen spinach, thawed, finely chopped and lightly queezed
	1/4 cup goat's milk feta cheese
	1/4 cup green onions, finely chopped
	1 tsp. oregano, fresh chopped
	1/2 garlic clove
	1/8 tsp salt
	1/8 tsp pepper
	1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
	2 thick slices sourdough bread, toasted
	1/2 tbsp vinegar
	4 eggs

## Instructions:
	In bowl, stir together spinach, feta, all but 1 tbsp of the green onions, oregano, garlic and pinch each of the salt and pepper. Stir in olive oil; spread over sourdough. Bake on baking sheet in 350 (F) oven until cheese is slightly softened, about 10 minutes.
	Meanwhile in deep skillet, heat 2 to 3 inches water over medium heat until simmering. Stir in vinegar. One at a time, crack eggs into small cup; gently slide into simmering water. Reduce heat to low; cook until whites are set and yolks are still soft, about 3 minutes. With slotted spool, transfer to paper towel-lined tray.
	Place 2 eggs on each toast; sprinkle with remaining salt, pepper and green onion.
